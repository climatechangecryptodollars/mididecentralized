 a few notes or a riff, 
 
 let others do the rest, 
 get back to it ,

 the things is to let a few notes or orchestrations or modifications, from users to users, try not to do it all. 
 
 and do not indicate the way you want the midi , for a decentralized composing thing, 
 ,
 
 for the full mididecentralized thing , it is , 
 
 a place for repository of partially done midi things that are mit license, 
 
 it will allow fork and pull request like here or and letting it all to others and getting it back at the end, 
 it only moves midis ,

  anonymity where you let the midi there without a way of checking who and whsa what he or she want of the midi, 
  a log for step back for doing other midi from it,
